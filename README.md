# React Native Task Manager

A simple React Native application to manage tasks, demonstrating the use of various React Native components such as View, Text, ScrollView, TextInput, StyleSheet, Button, FlatList, SectionList, and Image.

## Components

### View
The `View` component is a container that supports layout with flexbox, style, and touch handling. It is used extensively in this app to structure the layout of the UI.

### Text
The `Text` component is used to display text in the app. It supports nesting, styling, and touch handling.

### ScrollView
The `ScrollView` component provides a scrollable container that can host multiple views or components. It is used to enable vertical scrolling of content in the app.

### TextInput
The `TextInput` component is used to create text input fields, allowing users to enter text. It is used in the search bar to enable task searching.

### StyleSheet
The `StyleSheet` component is an abstraction similar to CSS StyleSheets. It helps in creating a consistent look and feel for the app by defining styles in one place.

### Button
The `Button` component is used to create clickable buttons that can trigger various actions in the app.

### FlatList
The `FlatList` component is used to render a list of items efficiently. It only renders the items that are currently visible on the screen. In this app, it is used to display a horizontal list of categories.

### SectionList
The `SectionList` component is similar to `FlatList` but supports section headers. It is used to render lists with section headers, making it ideal for displaying grouped data, such as ongoing tasks.

### Image
The `Image` component is used to display images, including icons and user profile pictures.
